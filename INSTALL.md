# Installtion guide

We suggest using [scoop](scoop.sh) to install all your dependencies to keep setup clean, install it before proceeding or use the official manuals of the dependencies

AFter installing it proceed with the following code

```pwsh
scoop install 7z git aria2
```

## Install NodeJS/ [Bun](https://bun.sh) , MongoDB

```pwsh
scoop install mongodb nodejs bun-canary
```

> We strongly suggest running the project through `bun` instead of `node`
